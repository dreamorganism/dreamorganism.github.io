<p>In building a new system of governance our design takes into consideration the ideas mentioned in our <a href="../overview/"    >introductory overview</a> . A super cheesey way of putting it is that the system should be one that is designed and run out of abundance and love, rather than fear and scarcity.</p>
<p>In order to combat a majority of the problems that arise in thought, behavioural and social competance: We want to incentive education and growth of the individual. We believe these are the tennants that will enable a more joyous state of being for individuals. This means tacking into account the pitfalls and traps in understanding and growth that often plague us in systems that we build.</p>
<p>We are taking an iterative approach to figuring out the system. We will formalize the designs and expirments we are going to run and make them avaliable shortly.</p>
<p>Here are some bullet points</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce required actions as much as possible. Attention and focus is a limited resource</li>
<li>Education &amp; mentorship</li>
<li>Belonging / exclusion as primary mechanisms for incentiving good behaviour</li>
<li>Trust first</li>
<li>Transparency and record of history as mechanisms for incentivizing behaviour</li>
<li>Incentivization for mediation and education for correctional behiavour instead of punishment</li>
<li>Incentivization for inhibition</li>
<li>Embrace conflict, it&rsquo;s a natural part of us and standing up for what we believe should be rewarded</li>
<li>Value is relative and not abstract, it should be represented as such</li>
<li>Measure what we care about, and not primarily abstractions over that</li>
<li>Use it or lose it, Continious education through required use of knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>Our first experiment in this area will most likely run with the following mechanics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Education program to onboard participants</li>
<li>All users of the system have the ability to create money</li>
<li>Log of arbitrary actions taken for each user</li>
<li>Log of transations taken</li>
<li>Rewards for mediation and conflict resolution</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea will be to see if we can</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase feeling of belonging</li>
<li>Increase sense of purpose</li>
<li>Increase understanding of place in society and universe as whole</li>
<li>Create value that enables us to thrive in the current system state</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to come take about self growth, value, governance; or find a way to contribute. Please come talk to us, we are waiting for you.</p>
