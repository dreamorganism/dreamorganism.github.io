		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Dreamorganism project is focused on building a human friendlier world given the simple premise that we (as opposed to others) need to take responsibility for change, and that we can do things better together.  What do I mean by human friendlier, and what do I mean by better? Perhaps those are questions for you to think about.</p>
<p>This overview is currently lacking in its entirety. However, I hope it will provide an understanding of the hypothesis we have about the problems we perceive, and how we tend to go about improving things.</p>
<p>We are currently researching possibilities to build systems that incentive self actualization. Ideally, such individuals are able to work together to a higher degree of effectiveness and create real value that in turn incentivizes and motivates greater participation from the larger society. We by no means believe that such solutions will be a panacea. We however hope, that such experiments are able to support and provide a higher quality of life for individuals, and at a minimum, provide learning outcomes for others that follow.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<h4 id="general">General</h4>
<p>Many of us are heavily educated, conditioned or hypnotized from a young age to ignore our discomforts and to memorize in order to secure a good future. Why don&rsquo;t we secure a good present first? Have you ever asked yourself what it is you want to do with your life? Are you making progress towards that vision? Do you even know what it is you want to do? What about your family, friends and larger social circles? Are you aware of the wishes of those around you? Are you able to support them to achieve their goals? By learning to search for security in the abstract future instead of from within ourselves and our social circles, we end up projecting our anxieties on to the outside world. We end up blaming the rich, the churches, the schools, our parents; but definitely not ourselves. Is this really a problem that exists? Take a look around at your relationships, your workplace, your country, your earth. We are in a state of ecological unawareness and are totally fouling our own nest. We need to learn how to build a healthy connection to ourselves, others and the universe.</p>
<h4 id="a-personal-beginning">A personal beginning</h4>
<p>The seeds for Dreamorganism were planted from a young age due to the general discomfort of not understanding my place, and the need to assign more than a decade of my life away studying for the future in order to do some undefined profession and to work, an activity generally seen as unpleasant. Is it no wonder despair may overwhelm the individual?</p>
<p>Things really started to change for me at the end of 2020 during a trauma therapy session. We often don&rsquo;t realize the pivotal moments in our life until much later, and this was definitely the case here. We had been discussing my childhood, and I was in quiet reflection with my eyes closed. &ldquo;That must have been very difficult&rdquo; he said, or something similar, while putting a comforting hand on my knee. I felt a slight pressure behind my eyes, and a weird feeling in my chest. I had been closed off for so long, that I don&rsquo;t even know if I ever knew how to feel my own pain, to share that with myself, to see my own plight, let alone to share it with others, or to make myself vulnerable.</p>
<p>The second thing that caught me by surprise was when I was asked, &ldquo;What is it you want to do in your life?&rdquo; Who would have known the answer &ldquo;To change how we are educated&rdquo; would come to the surface. The reconnection to the dream that had always been there, just waiting to be grasped. The birth of this project is still shrouded in many self doubts, I am in the process of starting to believe, to imagine, to deal with my fears; limitations; the opinions of my friends and peers, to stand true to myself.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Many individuals have fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of our existence and reality. These misunderstandings are a part of the reason why we act in ways that are detrimental to our wellbeing and to the wellbeing of those around us. We want to enable ourselves and other individuals to live fulfilling lives, to be able to communicate and support others.</p>
<p>What follows in this text is a brief description of our understanding of the problem of lack of understanding. This is more important than simply &ldquo;what are we going to do about it&rdquo;, as it enables us to have a common ground of understanding when tackling the solution space. Furthermore, the solution space is rather complex. We realize we don&rsquo;t have the answers and are instead interested in systems methods and a way of working that will allow us to iterate at pace.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lost in abstraction&rdquo; is a primary cause of misstepping, stagnation and therefore unnecessary suffering.</li>
<li>We can use science to tackle subconscious behaviours, habit and trauma.</li>
<li>Simpler, more understandable and more powerful systems for cooperation, governance and barter are possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lost-in-abstraction">Lost in Abstraction</h2>
<p>Our imagination and creative faculty enable us to do so many marvellous things. However, due to the mechanics of how we work, we have a tendency to get lost in abstraction. By this, I mean that it is extremely difficult for us to distinguish: the stories we tell ourselves, and the meaning from the stories we tell ourselves. Too often, we are telling ourselves stories about stories (useful to do if one can recognize that the story is a story about a story, and not a story about &ldquo;reality&rdquo;). It is difficult for us to recognize that what we perceive and communicate about, is not the same as the message being communicated. We will use Lost in Abstraction to refer to more than just a mix up of symbols for reality, it&rsquo;s about the entire working of our organism and how the mechanisms thereof effect our perceived experiences and further complicate understanding and action.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>Imagine all of a sudden you hear &ldquo;another voice&rdquo; inside your head. You could interpret this as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I can hear spirits&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gifted&rdquo; etc. The interpretation or story you choose to run with will in turn affect your subjective experience. Have you ever heard the story about how a spirit world exists? If one was to take that story and believe it: The pattern matching part of the brain would be looking out for patterns that exist between your perceived notion of reality (a spirit world existing) and other experiences. Scenes and memories from the past and from movies or books might be interpreted a new and the truth about the story being a reality is corroborated. The danger comes in here when we don&rsquo;t realize that the model of thought is just a model. The story or abstraction someone told us, has been confused for the state of reality. Many conflicts manifest because of such misunderstanding (I think the world is white, and you think it is black). On the individual level, a simple belief of &ldquo;I am X&rdquo;, can have monumental positive or negative consequences for an individuals behaviors or patterns, regardless of the validity. For a large portion of the world, many of us interpret money as value, even though in the ideal case it should be just an abstraction. In practice, we use money to give value to things we don&rsquo;t value, and in doing so devalue things that we actually value. Germany is rather infamous for their law-abiding citizens who will wait at red traffic lights in the middle of the night when no cars are around. The meaning and purpose of rules is disregarded and put in a subordinate position. The rule (abstraction or story) itself has become more important than the purpose. One doesn&rsquo;t have to look far back in history to see how this can go awry. We want individuals who make meaningful choices based on reality.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Communication gets a special mention under this category. Many people are able to feel patterns that are broken. However, the skills that are crucial in conversation which would enables us to start fixing these broken patterns are lacking. We need training in understanding these feelings first cognitively, and then secondly to be able to effectively communicate the meaning to another. Respectful communication is really not the norm in our societies yet. It&rsquo;s really rare to find such examples of healthy communication. Often times defence mechanisms are consciously or subconsciously used. Frustration, anger, dismissal, these are just some reactions one is likely to encounter when trying to communicate about topics that reside in the shadows.</p>
<p>Here is one way I can make you aware of this &ldquo;Lost in Abstraction&rdquo; idea intimately. Take a few moments to check in with your emotional status, and pay attention as I proceed to describe what Dreamorganism is attempting to build. Did you take those few moments? Focusing on your emotional state? Ok so the vision of Dreamorganism is to create a cult. Now, how do you feel? What are you thinking? Ok now what if I tell you the vision is to create a non-geographical government? How do you feel now? Ok the vision is to create a business! a guild of guilds! The vision is fdjsalf.</p>
<p>The thing is, there is a difference between what we are doing or trying to communicate, and what you perceive and interpret. The meaning we try to convey through words are often lost in the process of communication (by either party). This is due to e.g. the cognitive associations we have with the words or the emotional experiences triggered via the words. All of a sudden the meaning, the resonance or picture that is trying to be conveyed has been &ldquo;understood&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s say with a perspective that thoroughly distorts the actual intent. It takes skill to learn how to perceive meaning and not get lost in abstraction and reaction, to create effective outcomes and meaningful change in our experiences.</p>
<h3 id="always-hoping">Always hoping</h3>
<p>Always hoping represents another specific pattern that too often destroys our experience of the present moment. Disregarding the present for the future is a useful ability that humans have developed, which is valuable if you are not enjoying the present moment. Hoping is an activity one does in the present moment which is useful if it leads to plans which can be brought about to fruition through work and creative energy. If however one persists for many years in constant disregard of the present, in a state of dimmed focus and awareness while planning or hoping for better days, a gradual decline in the abilities to focus and be present will ensue.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to think about being present is in the ability to be actionary and to make progress. Symptoms of always hoping are often comparetory phrases containing if and would such as: &ldquo;If I would have had the opportunities&rdquo;, &ldquo;If I would have more money&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would be so happy if I were you&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="patterns--trauma">Patterns &amp; Trauma</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Lost in abstraction&rdquo; is primarily focused on the our subjective way of experiencing reality. It is more or less the idea that I am in control, that I am doing the entire universe, that I am god. On the opposite spectrum we can have objective reality, whereby we are outputs of the universe, puppets, the viewpoint that you are reactionary stuff that has no say in the matter. While many religions and philosophies talk using absolute truths, the delineated nature of subjective vs objective awareness means that anything we talk about is always bounded in a relative position. This is a long-winded way of me saying that there is more to it than simply changing our thinking. Most of what is going on in the universe is subconscious patterns. The subconscious nature means that there are many things that we are not aware of. Awareness is also a scale, so there are things you are less aware about than others. Being aware is generally only useful if the awareness can motivate some action. For example, you may want to be healthier or have more intimacy in your relationships. You might even be able to say what you need to do in order to make those goals happen. But then you don&rsquo;t act. The deeper awareness and understanding are still lacking in order to cause action. Action seems to be the embodiment of understanding. You may be somewhat aware of the problems of capitalism. However, how much of your patterns, your life, your energy is going into contribution towards capitalistic systems? What is it that you don&rsquo;t yet know that is stopping us from acting?</p>
<p>I will not forget the first time my map of reality shifted. My mind was totally blown, and it&rsquo;s still exploding today. The fabric and foundation of my interpretation of what I perceived to exist, what &ldquo;is&rdquo; or &ldquo;was true&rdquo;, &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, was completely malleable. I was so patterned to feeling anxiety given the thought of confrontation. That when I realized that this was no longer the case, I also noticed that I had unknowingly thought that everybody else experienced such situations in the exact same way. Projection. I have since then had many other mind-blowing experiences. One needs the right people to share such moments with, the difficulty of communication and people being lost in abstraction (thinking they understand the interpretations of what you are saying, or other reasons), often times, sharing experiences of change or transformation are met with defensive behaviour such as &ldquo;That is you&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not possible for me, or even, &ldquo;Yeah I already know that&rdquo;. That induced a strange feeling, something like that of being misunderstood and alone.</p>
<p>We have many subconscious experience based reaction patterns that encompass our feelings, thoughts and  physiology. In the case of adverse experience, we speak of Trauma that often trigger fight, flight or freeze systems that make it extremly difficult for us to function as we wish. Even if trauma were not involved, patterning, habits and the studying of reality is a power tool that gives us understanding of the subconscious. Geniuses can be raised.</p>
<h3 id="survival-and-safety">Survival and Safety</h3>
<p>Our existence and survival is extremely linked to safety. Providing safety and encouragement for exploration and growth is the primary job of parents. Safety is however not only a primary concern for the young. Ideally, the source of our safety should reside in ourselves, lest we are over dependent on conformance or attachment to externals.</p>
<p>Survival from a young age is entirely dependent on our ability to fit into the social constructs and norms around us. Many of these social norms are extremely damaging to us and are so ingrained into our thought and behaviour that we don&rsquo;t even see them. We are like toads who sit in boiling pots of water that are slowly overheating. Many of us who start to notice the predicament will probably not jump out because of the complexities involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>finding clarity in your observations</li>
<li>communication with others</li>
<li>challenging the collective intelligence</li>
<li>social pressure</li>
<li>inertia in taking decisions and actions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="faith-in-the-unknown">Faith in the unknown</h3>
<p>Trying new things and exploring is paramount to learning. However, many of us have an unhealthy relationship with fear or anxiety. Many of our institutioons and systems tend towards offering artificial safety. Individuals and institutions who cling to safety and stagnate commonly suffer from chronic anxiety and become fragile. There is no strength, growth or wisdom without movement; experimentation or failure. Such individuals remain naive and struggle to actualize their wishes in the world, they become confined to the safety nets around them, they stop being able to dream.</p>
<p>Besides clutching to safety, another common phenomenon is the delegation of faith to some authority figure. A dependence on looking to a leader for an answer, wanting to believe that someone can provide a truth for you to lean on, that someone can take some responsibility and tell us what is going on. Essentially I don&rsquo;t understand, but he does, so I&rsquo;ll take his position. It&rsquo;s a false reassurance and much nicer to believe that &ldquo;somebody knows&rdquo; instead of realizing &ldquo;nobody knows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The truth and reality of the situation is that most of the time medical experts, religious leaders, teachers or even ourselves have no clue about what is really going on. The quicker we embrace that, the more free energy we have for living. It also enables us as individuals to trust in ourselves, our voices, our opinions. In clutching to fear, we delegate responsibility away. What we actually want to do is embrace responsibility and to delegate away control of everything else, and to have faith that those things that are not under our control will work out. Time we spend being anxious about the things we can&rsquo;t change isn&rsquo;t really effective now is it :)</p>
<p>We need to embrace fear as a signal to prepare and to build faith in the unknown.</p>
<h3 id="learned-helplessness">Learned helplessness</h3>
<p>Leaned helplessness can occur after facing prolonged aversive stimulation that is not controllable. It can lead to depression and mental illnesses.</p>
<p>How many of us are carrying around feelings of helplessness and powerlessness due to the inability to comprehend or effect change against the situations that are causing us to suffer?</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it absolutely fascinating what humans have been able to achieve? With our power of abstraction, we have been able to unite with common shared understanding and come together to create ever larger social structures. With our shared philosophies being the basis for our decision making and social interactions, and money as an abstraction of value, we have enabled ourselves, to cooperate on a global level. No easy task. We are still experimenting with how to best manage ourselves and we can clearly see that being subconsciously controlled by secondary motivators leads to actions and that behaviour that is out of alignment with the needs and growth of the individual (and therefore the whole). We once again become reactionary, instead of being able to breath, de-stress and plan for the future. To prepare for the upcoming winter. Our hypothesis on governance is that we should model our systems on human behaviour and not simple abstract ideas and solutions. Furthermore, the weaknesses of human nature should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The simplest form of observation we can have is between two individuals. Most of us have lost touch with the more powerful subconscious communication that is taking place. Safety, threat, reward, encouragement, affirmation, rejection, punishment, oneness, sensibility to such things is important for a joyous life. Animal whisperers are a great example of a skill set that we should be learning to enhance our understanding and interaction with all animals. Yes humans are animals too, or if that doesn&rsquo;t tickle your fancy, then what about the class of desserts of which apple strudel would belong to?</p>
<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>Value, something that causes us to act. Why do we act? Perhaps action or movement is done in order to fulfil some need? If one is to sit alone in a room, you will eventually move to fulfil some need. Furthermore, everything in the universe is constantly in movement. A subset of the universe exists in order to move so that existence can continue. Action, value, fulfilment, existence. Since we exist, why not do it in a fulfiling way? In a very real way, learning, growing up or being mature is about being able to bring fulfilment into the world. Let&rsquo;s consider the following actions as undesirable, actions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>make us feel unfulfilled</li>
<li>causes harm to ourselves</li>
<li>causes harm to the organism of life that we partake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this misstepping could be attributed to &ldquo;Lost in Abstraction&rdquo;. Our thinking is twisting and turning and full of discontinuities between the parts so that it is extremely difficult to realize that this is even the case and that things could be different. The systems we create are also nightmarish creatures of complexity. Do you understand the monetary policies, political systems, the laws, the rules and the various effects that these have on you? There are many perverted systems that have been designed around obtaining specific results. More profit, more sales, more consumer interaction. Once your eyes start to see this manipulation taking place, it&rsquo;s a very annoying and disturbing feeling.</p>
<p>In school, I remember wanting to know, &ldquo;why do I have to learn this?&rdquo;. In asking such a question, I was interested in the purpose or perceived value in the activity. I felt very dejected for many years, not understanding the purpose of my day to day activities. &ldquo;Learned helplessness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Always hoping&rdquo; seem appropriate ways of interpreting such experience. It seems as if there is no meaning in the  present other than to suffer. Have you asked your friends or family what their dreams are? What do they want to do? Often times one will come to realize: I never asked. A large percentage of people don&rsquo;t even know the answer to this. For the individual, isn&rsquo;t it fulfilment that one ultimately seeks?</p>
<p>By observing humans, we can learn some fundamental tenants about value.</p>
<ul>
<li>extremely malleable, it can be created or destroyed almost instantly</li>
<li>dependent on relationship of subjectivity and objectivity, relative</li>
<li>dependent on current state of the individual and relationship to other</li>
</ul>
<p>The more of something I have, the less of it that exists. The time and place that I find myself in will also impact how much I value something. Value is really like the weather, it&rsquo;s going to change and there isn&rsquo;t much we can do about it. Our systems of value representation (if we are to use any) should respect such observations and counteract the tendency to get lost in abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Humans, indeed other animals as well, learn to infer causality between the actions that we take and the effects that those have (through coupling and association). Rats can be trained to operate with secondary motivators and start to prefer abstract value or tokens over their primary needs (or so I have read). The coupling patterns and associations can be controlled by us to influence the &ldquo;game&rdquo; that the rats will play. We can understand human systems in a similar fashion. A complicated mess of associations and patterns. We however, through thought and communication, tie myths and stories to the perceived causalities, which results in further mix-ups between the myth and the meaning. By taking a regard for this situation via education, we believe people can live more fulfiling loving lives. Such individuals will naturally value and act differently and, as a result of their own transfiguration, transform the societies and nations of which they reside. We aim to increase the amount of people who can support themselves and others in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I hope to use the experience I have gained through growing up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Movement_International"     class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new religious movement</a>, working with software, battling over a decade with mental health issues, the inspiration and movement to decentralize (ala cryptocurrencies), as well as the shifting environment due the pandemic to positively change our social fabric.</p>
