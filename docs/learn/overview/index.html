		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Dreamorganism is focused on experiments to build a human friendler world given the simple premise that we (as opposed to others) need to take responsibility for change, and that we can do things better together.  What do we mean by human friendler, and what do we mean by better?</p>
<p>Another way of putting &ldquo;human friendlier&rdquo; into words would be the removal of superfulous suffering in our societies.</p>
<p>This overview is currently lacking in it&rsquo;s entirety. However, I hope it will provide an understanding of the hypothesis we have about the problems we percieve, and how we tend to go about improving things.</p>
<p>We are currently researching possibilites to build systems that incentive self actualization. Ideally such individuals are able to work together to a higher degree of effectivness and create real value that in turn incentivies and motivates greater particiption from the larger society. We by no means believe that such solutions will be a panacea. We however hope, that such experiments are able to support and provide a higher quality of life for some indivduals, and at a minimum, provide learning outcomes for others that follow.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>The seeds for Dreamorganism were planted from a young age due to the general discomfort of not understanding one&rsquo;s place, and the need to assign more than a decade of one&rsquo;s life away studying for the future in order to do some undefined profession and to work, an activity generally seen as unpleasant. Is it no wonder despair may overwhelm the individual?</p>
<p>Things really started to change for me at the end of 2020 during a trauma therapy session with Niels Baum. It&rsquo;s often the case that we don&rsquo;t realize the pivotal moments in our life until much later, and this was definitley the case here. We had been discussing my childhood, and I was in quiet reflection with my eyes closed. &ldquo;That must have been very difficult&rdquo; he said, or something similar while putting a comforting hand on my knee. I felt a slight pressure behind my eyes, and a wierd feeling in my chest. I had been closed off for so long, that I don&rsquo;t even know if I ever knew how to feel my own pain, to share that with myself, to see my own plight, let alone to share it with others or to make myself vulnerable.</p>
<p>The second things that caught me by surprise was when I was asked &ldquo;What is it you want to do in your life?&rdquo; Who would have known the answer &ldquo;To change how we are educated&rdquo; would come up to the surface. The reconnection to the dream that had always been there waiting to be grasped. The birth of this project is still shrouded in many self doubts, I am in the process of starting to believe, to imagine, to deal with my fears; limitations; the opinions of my friends and peers, to stand true to myself.</p>
<p>The main reason I&rsquo;m starting this project is because it feels like I have no choice but to. I want to provide support to those who are only drowning in despair with the way that things curently are. As Niels Baum put it, let&rsquo;s put more love into the world.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Many individuals have fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of our exiestence and reality. These misunderstandings are a part of the reason we act in ways that are detrimental to our wellbeing and to the wellbeing of those around us. We want to enable ourselves and other individuals to live fulfilling lives, to be able to communicate and support others.</p>
<p>What follows in this text is a brief description of our understanding of the the problem of lack of understanding. This is more important than simply &ldquo;what are we going to do about it&rdquo;, as it enables us to have a common ground of understanding when tackling the solution space. Furthermore the solution space is rather complex. We realize we don&rsquo;t have the answers and are instead interested in methods and a way of working that will allow us to iterate at pace.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lost in abstraction&rdquo; is a primary cause of misstepping, stagnation and therefore uncessary suffering.</li>
<li>We can use science to tackle subconcious behaviours, habit and trauma.</li>
<li>Simpler, more understandable systems for cooperation, governance and barter are possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lost-in-abstraction">Lost in Abstraction</h2>
<p>Our imagination and creative facaulty enable us to do so many marvelous things. However, due to the mechanics of how we work, we have a tendancy to get lost in abstraction. By this, I mean that it is extremley difficult for us to distinguish: the stories we tell ourselves, and the meaning from the stories we tell ourselves. Too often we are telling ourselves stories about stories (useful to do if one can recognize that the story is a story about a story, and not a story about &ldquo;reality&rdquo;).  Anothe way to put it, is that what we percieve and communicate about, is not the same as the message being communicated. Lost in Abstraction is more than just a mixup of symbols for reality, it&rsquo;s about the entire working of the mind and how the mechanisms there of effect our percieved experiences and further complicate understanding and action.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>Imagine all of a sudden you hear &ldquo;another voice&rdquo; inside your head. You could interpret this as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I can hear spirits&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gifted&rdquo; etc. The interpretation or story you choose to run with will in turn effect your subjective experience. Have you ever heard the story about how a spirit world exists? If one was to take that story and believe it: The pattern matching part of the brain would be looking out for patterns that exist between your percieved notion of reality (a spirit world existing) and other experiences. Scenes and memories from the past and from movies or books might be interpreted a new and the truth about the story being a reality is corroborated. The danger comes in here when we don&rsquo;t realize that the model of thought is just a model. The story or abstraction some one told to us, has been confused for the state of reality. Many conflicts resolve on national levels because of such misunderstanding (I think the world is white, and you think it is black). On the individual level, a simple belif of &ldquo;I am X&rdquo;, can have monumental positive or negative consequences for an individuals behavior or patterns regardless of the validity. For a large portion of the world, many of us interpret money as value even though in the ideal case it should be just an abstraction. In practice we use money to give value to things we don&rsquo;t value and in doing so devalue things that we actually value. Germany is rather infamous for their law abiding citizens who will wait at red traffic lights in the middle of the night when no cars are around. The meaning and purpoes of rules is disregarded and put in a subordinate position. The rule (abstraction or story) itself has become more important than the purpose. One doesn&rsquo;t have to look far back in histoy to see how this can go awry. We want individuals who make meaningful choices based on reality.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Communication gets a special mention under this category. Many people are able to feel patterns that are broken. However, the skills that are crucial in conversation which would enables us to start fixing these broken patterns are lacking. We need training in understanding these feelings first cognitiviely, and than secondly to be able to effectivle communicate the meaning to another. Respectful communication is really not the norm in our societies yet. It&rsquo;s really rare to find such examples of healthy communication. Often times defense mechanisms are consiously or subconsiously used. Frustration, anger, dismisial, these are just some reactions one is likely to encounter when trying to communicate about topics that reside in the shadows of peoples personalities.</p>
<p>Here is one ways I can make you aware of this &ldquo;Lost in Abstraction&rdquo; idea intimitatley. Take a few moments to check in with your emotional status, and pay attention to it as I proceed to describe what Dreamorganism is attempting to build. Did you take those few moments? Focusing on your emotional state? Ok so the vision of Dreamorganism is to create a cult. Now how do you feel? What are you thinking? Ok now what if I tell you the vision is to create a non geographical government? How do you feel now? Ok the vision is to create a business! a guild of guilds! The vision is fdjsalf.</p>
<p>The thing is, there is a difference between what i am doing or trying to communicate, and what you percieve and interpret. The meaning we try to convey through words are often lost in the process of communication (by either party). This could be due to the cognitive associations we have with the words or the emotional experiences triggered via the words. All of a sudden the meaning, the resonance or picture that is trying to be conveyed has been &ldquo;understood&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s say with a perspective that thouroughly distorts the actual intent. It takes skill to learn how to percieve meaning and not get lost in abstraction and reaction, to create effective outcomse and meaningful change in our objective experiences.</p>
<h3 id="always-hoping">Always hoping</h3>
<p>Always hoping represents another specific pattern that too often destroys our experience of the present moment. Disregarding the present for the future is a useful ability that humans have developed which is valuable if you are not enjoying the present moment. Hoping is an an activity one does in the present moment which is useful if it leads to plans which can be brought about to fruition through work and creative energy. If one persits for many years in in disregard of the present, in a state of dimmed focus and awarness while planning or hoping for better days, a gradual decline in the abilities to focus and be present will ensue.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to think about being present is in the ability be actionary and to make progress. Symptoms of always hoping are often comparetory phrases contain if and would such as: &ldquo;If I would have had the opportunites &hellip; &ldquo;, &ldquo;If I would have more money than &hellip;&rdquo;, &quot; &ldquo;I would be so happy if I were you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Detatchment from the present is probably often a result of present moment discomfort or past traumas.</p>
<h2 id="patterns--trauma">Patterns &amp; Trauma</h2>
<p>Sorry about this section. It still needs some work to simplify it :/</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost in abstraction&rdquo; is primarily focused on the mind which is our subjective way of experiencing reality. It is more or less the idea that I am in control, that i am doing the entire universe, thatI am god. On the opposite spectrum we can have objective reality, whereby we are an output of the universe, a puppet, the viewpoint that the interaction of your cells is what is creating your mind. While there are many relgions and philosophies that try to talk about absolute truths. The deliniated nature of subjective vs objective awarness means that anything we talk about is always bounded in a relative position. This is a long winded way of me saying that there is more to it than simply changing our thinking. Most of what is going on in the universe is subconsious patterns. The subconsious nature means that there are many things that you are not aware of. Awarness is also a scale so there are things you are less aware about than others. Being aware is generally only useful if the awarness can motivate you some action. For example you man want to be healthier or have more intimicy in your relationships. You might even be able to tell me what you need to do in order to make those goals happen. But than you don&rsquo;t act. The awarness and understanding are still lacking in order to cause action. Action seems to be the embodiment of understanding. You many be somewhat aware of the problems of captialism. How much of your patterns, your life, your energy is going into contribution to capatialist systems. What is it so that you don&rsquo;t yet know that is stopping us from acting?</p>
<p>I will not forget the first time my map of reality shifted. My mind was totally blown and it&rsquo;s still exploding today. The fabric and foundation of my interpretation of what I percieved to exist, what &ldquo;is&rdquo; or &ldquo;was true&rdquo;, &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, was complelety malleable. I was so patternized to feeling anxiety given the thought of confrontation. That when I realized that this was no longer the case I also noticed that I had unknownly thought that everybody else experienced such situations in the exact same way. Just one of the many reasons that communication was so difficult for me. I have since than had many other mind blowing expereinces. One needs the right people to share such moments with, the difficulty of communication and people being lost in abstraction (thinking they understnad the interpreationas of what you are saying or other reasons), often time sharing experiences of change, transformation are met with defensive behavior behavior such as &ldquo;That is you&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not possible for me. or even &ldquo;Yeah I already know that&rdquo;. That induced a strange feeling, something like that of being misunderstood and alone.</p>
<p>We have many subconsious experience based reaction patterns that encompass our feelings, thoughts and  physiology. In the case of adverse experience we speak of Trauma that often trigger fight, flight or freeze systems that make it extremly difficult for us to function as we wish. Even if trauama were not involved, patterning, habits and the whole field of behavioural science is a power tool that gives us understanding of the subconsious. One of the interesting findings from the field is that geniusues can be raised.</p>
<h3 id="survival-and-safety">Survival and Safety</h3>
<p>Our existance and survival is extremely linked to safety. Providing safety and encouragment for exploration and growth is the primary job of parents. Babies that don&rsquo;t recieve comfort, love and a feeling of safety are more likely to xyz.</p>
<p>Your survival from a young age is entirley dependant on our ability to fit into the social constructs and norms around us. Many of these social normals are extremely damaging to us and are so ingrained into our thought and behaviour that we don&rsquo;t even see them. We are like toads who sit in boiling pots of water that are slowly overheating. Many of us who start to notice the predicimant will probably not jump out because of the complexities involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>finding clarity in your observations</li>
<li>communication with others</li>
<li>challenging the collective intelligence</li>
<li>challenging social pressure</li>
<li>inertia in taking decsions and action</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>What I really want to highlight with this section is the power that can be gained by studying object reality. It makes sense to explain it as such and not simply label it as science because In my expereince many people will understand and believe in science. Some smarter folks might say they believe in results that are scientific or things that scientists say. This is largely People delegeting authority of understanding, once one gets into understanding objective reality you realize there are no absolutes and outrighly believing in &ldquo;science&rdquo; could be the same error of thought as delegating authority to churches or holy scriptures.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<h3 id="faith-in-the-unknown">Faith in the unknown</h3>
<p>Trying new things and exploring is paramount to learning. However, many of us have an unhealthy relationship with fear or anxiety. Many of our instituons and systems tend towards offering artificial safety. Individuals and institutions who cling to safety and stagnate suffer under chronic anxiety and become weak and fragile, there is no strength or wisdowm without movement, experimentation or failure. Such individuals remain naive and struggle to actualize their wishies int the world, they become confined to the safety nets around them, they stop being able to dream.</p>
<p>Besides clutching to safety, another common phenomenon is the delegation of faith to some authority figure. A dependance on looking to a leader for an answer, wanting to belive that someone can provide a truth for you to lean on, that someone can take some responsibility and tell us what is going on. Essentially I don&rsquo;t understand, but he does so I&rsquo;ll take his position. It&rsquo;s a false reassurance and much nicer to believe that &ldquo;somebody knows&rdquo; instead of realizing &ldquo;noboy knows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The truth and reality of the situation is that most of the time medical experts, religious leaders, teachers or even ourselves have no clue about what is really going on. The quicker we embrace that, the more free energy we have for living. It also enables us as individuals to trust in ourselves, our voices, our opinions. In clutching to fear we delegate away responsibility. What we actually want to do is embrace responsibility and to delegate away control of everything else and to have faith that those things that are not under our control will work out. Time we spend being anxious about the things we can&rsquo;t change isn&rsquo;t really effective now is it :)</p>
<p>We need to embrace fear as a signal to prepare and to build faith in the unknown.</p>
<h3 id="learned-helplessness">Learned helplessness</h3>
<p>Leaned helplessness can occur after facing prolonged aversive stimulation that is not controllable. It can lead to depression and mentall illnesses.</p>
<p>How many of us are carrying around feelings of helplessness and powerlessness due to the inability to comprehend or effect change against the situations that are causing us to suffer?</p>
<p>Control of the mind, and finding safety and support can provide a training and a space for individuals who are aware of problems and the lack of the control
It&rsquo;s a bit perverse that being aware of</p>
<p>Our understnaind and thinking  There is a relationship between control and the unknown. Our understanding of what we can and cannot do, and of what may be directly effect the Control is linked tOur understanding of contthe unknown and the control we posses, control, the lack thereof, the unknown., the way we think about control and what is happening to us has an
a lack of control over an aversive stimulus</p>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint this makes sense. The being that is made to suffer with no way out should eventually die out. How perverse would it be if such a state of existence would lead to a renewed sense of vigour for emancipation and understanding that wills life in to existence only to suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>The Learned helplessness is Martin Seligman&rsquo;s theory on depression. There are some experiments involving dogs and electricity but let&rsquo;s just skip to the results. The understanding now is that we have a certain way of dealing with the unknown. If the unknown is presented to us in a way that we can comprehend, even if it is negative. We don&rsquo;t become depressive. We can get by becase we have an understanding of the issue at hand. In the case of the dogs, the dogs who were shocked just after a light came on remained &ldquo;sane&rdquo;, they were able to run away after being released, there immunity or sleep cycle wasn&rsquo;t effected. In the control group who were randomly shocked. What is called a &ldquo;learned helpessness&rdquo; is developed. Essentially there is nothing you can do about life, the unknown. It&rsquo;s incomprhensible to the being. And so the being gives up, sickness develops, the being looses the will to live. While the experiments of Martin are extreme.</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t absolutley fascinating what humans have been able to achieve? With our power of abstraction, we have been able to unite with common shared understanding and come together to create ever larger social structures. With philosophy and religion being basis for our decsions making and social interactions, and money as an abstraction of value, we have enabled ourselves to cooperate on a global level. No easy task. We are still experimenting with how to best manage ourselves and we can clearly see that being subconsiously controlled by secondary motivators leads to actions and that behaviour that is out of alignment with the needs and growth of the individual. We once again become reactionary, instead of being able to breath, destress and plan for the future. To prepare for the upcoming winter. Our hypothesis on governance is that we should model our systems on human behaviour and not simple abstract ideas and solutions. Furthermore the weaknesses of human nature should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The simplest form of observation we can have is between two individuals. Because of our symbolistic thinking most of us have lost touch with the more powerful subconsious communication that is taking place. Safety, threat, reward, encouragment, affirmation, rejection, punishment, oneness, Sensibility to such things is important for a joyous life. Animal whisperers are a great example of a skillset that we should be learning to enhance our understand and interaction with all animals. Yes humans are animals too.</p>
<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>Value, something that caues us to act. Why do we act? Perhaps action or movement is done in order to fulfill some need. If one is to sit alone in a room. You will eventually move to fulfill some need. Furethermore, everything in the universe is constantly in movement. Does a subset of the universe exists in order to move so that existance can continue. Action, value, fulfillment, existance. Since we exist, why not do it in a fulfillilling way? In a very real way, learning, growing up or being mature is about being able to bring fulfillment into the world. Let&rsquo;s consider the following actions as undesirable, actions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>make us feel unfulfilled</li>
<li>causes harm to ourselves</li>
<li>causes harm to the organism of life that we partake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this misstepping could be attributed to &ldquo;Lost in Abstraction&rdquo;. Our thinking is twisting and turing and full of disscontinutuies between the parts so that it is extremley difficult to realize that this is even the case and that things could be different. The systems we create are also nightmarish creatures of complexity. Do you understand the monetary policies, politicial systems, the laws, the rules and the variour effects that thesee have on you? There are many perverted systems that have been designed around obtaining specific results. More profit, more sales, more consumer interaction. Once your eyes start to see this manipulation taking place it&rsquo;s a very annoying and distrubing feeling.</p>
<p>In school, I remember wanting to know &ldquo;why do I have to learn this?&rdquo;. In asking such a question I was interested in the purpose or percieved value in the activity. As prior mentioned I felt very dejected for many years, not understanding the purpose of my day to day activites. &ldquo;Learned helplessness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Always hoping&rdquo; seem approriate ways of interrpreting such experience. It seems as if there is no meaning in the  present other than to suffer. Have you asked your friends or family? What is your dream? What do you want to do? Often times One will come to realize: fuck i never asked. A large percentage of people don&rsquo;t even know the answer to this. For the individual, isn&rsquo;t it fulfillmentt that one ultimitley seeks?</p>
<p>By observing humans we can learn some fundamental tennants about value.</p>
<ul>
<li>extremely malleable, it can be created or destroyed almost instantly</li>
<li>dependant on relationship of subjectivity and objectivity, relative</li>
<li>dependant on current state of the individual and relationship to other</li>
</ul>
<p>The more of something I have, the less of it that exists. The time, and place that I find myself will also impact how much I value something. Value is really like the weather, it&rsquo;s going to change and their isn&rsquo;t much we can do about it. Our systems of value representation (if we are to use any) should respect such observations and conteract the tendency to get lost in abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Humans, indeed other animals as well, learn to infer causality between the actions that we take and the effects that those have (through coupling and association). Rats can be trained to operate with secondary motivators and start to prefer abstract value or tokens over their primary needs. The coupling patterns and associations can be controlled by us to influence the &ldquo;game&rdquo; that the rats will play. We can understand human systems in a similar fashion. A complicated mess of associations and patterns. We however through thought and communication, tie myths and stories to the percieved causalities which results in further mix ups between the myth and the meaning. By taking a regard for this situation, we believe we can educate so that people can live more fulfilling loving lives. Such individuals will naturally value and act differntly and as a result of their own transiguration, transform the societeis and nations of which they reside. We aim to increase the amount of people who can support themselves and others in a meaninguful way.</p>
<p>I hope to use the experience I have gained through growing up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Movement_International"     class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new religious movement</a>, working with software, battling over a decade with mental health issues, the inspiration and movement to decentralize (ala cryptocurrneices), as well as the shifting environemnt due the the pandemic to positivitely change our social fabric.</p>
