      <description>Introduction Dreamorganism is focused on experiments to build a human friendler world given the simple premise that we (as opposed to others) need to take responsibility for change, and that we can do things better together. What do we mean by human friendler, and what do we mean by better?
Another way of putting &amp;ldquo;human friendlier&amp;rdquo; into words would be the removal of superfulous suffering in our societies.

      <description>Governance In building a new system of governance our design takes into consideration the ideas mentioned in our introductory overview . A super cheesey way of putting it is that the system should be one that is designed and run out of abundance and love, rather than fear and scarcity.
In order to combat a majority of the problems that arise in thought, behavioural and social competance: We want to incentive education and growth of the individual.</description>
