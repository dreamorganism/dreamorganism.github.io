# üçÑ Robust Social Safety

Let's build safe havens for those who don't have them. Social connections, knowledge, real wealth! Prosperity is ours for the taking.

On the hierachy of needs, one can take a position and argue from either end of the spectrum. From a universal standpoint self actualization would seem to be the most important, as without it, how could any of this exist? In a similar vain, I as an individual being, this collection of cells that has gathered and evolved throughout the millenia, only exist in an intertwined matter and harmony with all that is going on around me. The realization of the mutual interdependance of all "things" makes it clear that the chronic unconsious clutching to safety could be a by product of the requirment to conform to an unhealthy society in order to recieve acceptance.

Acceptance of ourselves, others, and the universe.


# üçÑ Respecting the Individual

Due to the functioning of the brain it's extremely difficult to keep abstractions and their reifications apart.

Systems are never built for their own sake. Systems need energy to run. A sub system that spends energy mainting or propinging itself up is going to require continued effort and energy from the outisde, energy from the individuals in the system.

Modifying any system in order to produce a result in the individual is by design manipulation,  Lets's default to repsectful communication and allowing for emergent behaviour of systems to occur.

# üçÑ Transforming Society

There are no fully isolated systems. Everything hangs together in a beautful web. We want to be able to proivide support to ALL individuals.
