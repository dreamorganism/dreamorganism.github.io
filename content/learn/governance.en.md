## Governance

In building a new system of governance our design takes into consideration the ideas mentioned in our [introductory overview](../overview/) . A super cheesey way of putting it is that the system should be one that is designed and run out of abundance and love, rather than fear and scarcity.

In order to combat a majority of the problems that arise in thought, behavioural and social competance: We want to incentive education and growth of the individual. We believe these are the tennants that will enable a more joyous state of being for individuals. This means tacking into account the pitfalls and traps in understanding and growth that often plague us in systems that we build.

We are taking an iterative approach to figuring out the system. We will formalize the designs and expirments we are going to run and make them avaliable shortly.

Here are some bullet points
- Reduce required actions as much as possible. Attention and focus is a limited resource
- Education & mentorship
- Belonging / exclusion as primary mechanisms for incentiving good behaviour
- Trust first
- Transparency and record of history as mechanisms for incentivizing behaviour
- Incentivization for mediation and education for correctional behiavour instead of punishment
- Incentivization for inhibition
- Embrace conflict, it's a natural part of us and standing up for what we believe should be rewarded
- Value is relative and not abstract, it should be represented as such
- Measure what we care about, and not primarily abstractions over that
- Use it or lose it, Continious education through required use of knowledge

Our first experiment in this area will most likely run with the following mechanics.
- Education program to onboard participants
- All users of the system have the ability to create money
- Log of arbitrary actions taken for each user
- Log of transations taken
- Rewards for mediation and conflict resolution

The idea will be to see if we can
- Increase feeling of belonging
- Increase sense of purpose
- Increase understanding of place in society and universe as whole
- Create value that enables us to thrive in the current system state
