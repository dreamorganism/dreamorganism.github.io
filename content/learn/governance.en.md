## Governance

### Introduction

We are building a new system of governance! 

In building a new system of governance, our design takes into consideration the ideas mentioned in our [introductory overview]({{< relref "overview/" >}}) . A super cheesy way of putting it is that the system should be one that is designed and run out of abundance and love, rather than fear and scarcity. Although that doesn't fully capture the intent. One needs to take reality into considerations, abundance and scarcity, both sides, and the tendency to see or prefer only one.

Human governance essentially only works on a large scale because of conformance or belief from individuals that provides a mutual ground for them to stand on. Our work in terms of governance pertains to the entire lifecycle of researching, building, monitoring and the evolution of such a ground.

By leaning on digital technology we can build out such systems that can model relationship, trust, action and provide a lens onto value and offer transparency in a way that provides users the ability to benefit and partake in the social fabric that they are a part of. 

We want to essentially update the way we use codes and myths to bond us together. The model that is used by America, "the declaration of independence", doesn't really have an update cycle.

#### Motivation

The initial target group for the first experiment is with small communities. This is because some of the best work is often done decoupled from monetary motivation. Small communities form that provide connection, community, contacts, knowledge transfer or simply leisure which provide a substantial amount of value to the members of such communities. You cannot buy friendship, such communities can provide a greater degree of value than that of professional paid services. Why don't we then value them as such? 

Such groups often rely on donations, membership fees or sponsorships to be run. Religious groups commonly rely on tithing. In certain cases, business activities are undertaken. In all cases we see that ownership, power and fiscal wealth are accumulated and controlled by the entity. The entity than acts as a proxy to the individuals and is supposed to enact the needs and wishes of its members. Unfortunately many benefits end up being affiliated to the entity and not with the individual directly.

Let's look at governments, governments provide a lot of great support to all individuals in the country. For instance streets, access to markets, people and connections. People and connections is the most important one. If we look at religious communities this is often times what they are really offering. The global connections and potential to interact with people of similar philosophy and ground of being, community. One can interact and communicate about deeper things than might be possible without this. Anyone who has migrated or gone travelling generally enjoys running across people from the same country or town, of course there is a funny phenomenon where travelers complain about meeting too many of their own kind. I hypothesize that most people here are projecting their dissatisfaction and phoniness their traveling experience onto the "other people" that are also traveling and making such experiences as one doesn't have the guts to really travel.

Many people hypostulate this ability to form myth and abstricaton, and to bond and unserstand has been the power house of the human brain that allows us to form larger and larger social circles. From an evolutionary perspective it seems that the larger brain size has been corelated with the abilitty to handle more inforamtion, complexity and larger social networks. For individuals or larger groups who are offering services and would like to build thriving communities that can grow together and have shared resources, it would be cool to have a model where the indiviuals benieft, where the learnings, the work that they provide, the events that they support, the support that they give each other can have the beniefets of abstract notions of value, it can be incenvtiviesd and rewarded, and the people of merit can flourish and support other memebrs and take on responsibility as needed. This could be a novel way to suuport delegation, growth, movement and the abaility to live more universe friendly. Empowering the individual seems to be the best way to do this. Building merit based on the actions that we do. Of course we are embeded in a fiat world so we need to iterate on a philosyhy where each indiviual can have as much empowerment as possible in the decsion making procees about where fiat gets distributed. Ideally this enables a style of collaboaration not just on a small group level, but scale up to billions of individuals. We are going to start small though.


### Shared ground

The principles and code that are often declared via a group do not in themselves represent what happens in actuality. Both aspects are equally important. We want to firstly improve the monitoring of behaviours so that we can better evaluate trust and rely on higher quality filters for knowledge inference and value. Secondly, the continuous updating of principles and the way they are communicated, understood, shared, and consumed.

In order to combat a majority of the problems that arise in thought, behavioural and social competence: We want to incentivize education and growth of the individual. We believe these are the tnnants that will enable a more joyous state of being for individuals. This means tacking into account the pitfalls and traps in understanding and growth that often plague us in systems that we build.

We are taking an iterative approach to system design; the solution should fit the problem. We aim to update as things progress.

Here are some bullet points
- Reduce required actions as much as possible. Attention and focus is a limited resource
- Education & mentorship
- Internal > external
- Belonging and exclusion
- Trust first
- Transparency and record of history as mechanisms for incentivizing behaviour
- Incentivization for mediation and education instead of punishment
- Embrace conflict, it's a natural part of us and standing up for what we believe should be rewarded
- Value is relative and not abstract, it should be represented as such
- Measure what we care about, and not primarily abstractions over that
- Use it or lose it, Continuous learning through required use of knowledge

Our first experiment in this area will most likely run with the following mechanics.
- Education program to onboard participants
- In users of have the ability to print money 
- Log of arbitrary actions taken for each user
- Log of transactions taken
- Rewards for mediation and conflict resolution

The idea will be to see if we can
- Increase Joy of life
  - Increase feeling of belonging
  - Increase sense of purpose
  - Increase autonomy and creative power
  - Decrease stress
  - Increase understanding of place in society and universe
  - Create value that enables us to thrive in the current system state

### Technical Implementation

To support the Dreamorganism governance model, we build an run a system to manage transactional metadata. The user interface is going to be rather bare at the beginning, but it will be decoupled so that we have the ability to provide and experiment with: 

- Voice and other smart digital assistants
- Pre generated static sites
- First class query and programming support

Things that are **NOT** important in the initial system
- security
- privacy
- scaling

We are lucky enough to have a plethora of competing technical solutions to provide solutions to data ownership, privacy and consensus which will be evaluated and tested as needs evolve.
