**Hello!**

Come join us for a few hours this saturday to explore health & communication.

We aim to impart a heightend awarness and ability to grow, learn, connect and heal. 

We will be doing this through a series of individual, partner and group exercises.

> <em>We will often be hurt in our lives, </br>
and that is totally ok,</br>
we have to fall, in order to learn,</br>
None of us are predestined to be alone,</br>
Only through experimenting will we come closer to our goals,</br>
We have to talk and build understanding,</br>
To notice and name feelings and thoughts,</br>
To speak things out,</br>
I find myself, through my way of understanding you. </br>
</em>

Three years ago I came into contact with [Non violent communication](https://www.cnvc.org/about) and [Crucial Conversations](https://cruciallearning.com/crucial-conversations-for-dialogue/), this inspired me to learn about emotions and invest in my communnication skill.

- I suffered with depression for many years, this gave me experience in techniques of psychology and therapy.
- As a software developer and engineer I learned to understand complex systems
- Through [Alan Watts](https://alanwatts.org/life-of-alan-watts/), I learned about spirituality and zen
- Through sports i learned about the soul, mind body connection.

I am currently focusing [on](../learn/overview/) developing new technology to improve the [collaboration of humans](https://cardano.org/).
