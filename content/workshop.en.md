**Hello!**

Come join us for a few hours this saturday to explore health & communication.

We aim to impart a heightend awarness and ability to grow, learn, connect and heal. 

We will be doing this through a series of individual, partner and group exercises.

> <em>We will often be hurt in our lives, </br>
and that is totally ok,</br>
we have to fall, in order to learn,</br>
None of us are predestined to be alone,</br>
Only through experimenting will we come closer to our goals,</br>
We have to talk and build understanding,</br>
To notice and name feelings and thoughts,</br>
To speak things out,</br>
I find myself, through my way of understanding you. </br>
</em>
